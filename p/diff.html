<p>One common question you may want answered is how a file has changed since a specific point in the history, like a tag. If I wanted to know how the Git project README has changed since the initial 1.6 release, I can run &#8216;diff&#8217; with a path limiter:</p>

<pre><code>$ git diff v1.6.0 -- README 
diff --git a/README b/README

<p>That will compare the README file to the version in your working directory - if you&#8217;ve made local changes, staged or unstaged, they will show up in this diff.</p>

<h3 id='changes_between_two_commits'>changes between two commits</h3>

<p>If you want to compare a file between two snapshots - two versions of your project - instead of comparing a snapshot and the contents of your working directory, you can specify both versions on the command line:</p>

<pre><code>$ git diff v1.0 v1.1</code></pre>

<p>That would give you a big diff of all the changes between the two snapshots that those two commits point to, as if they were both constituted in two directories and you ran the unix &#8216;diff&#8217; tool on them.</p>

<p>You can also use some of the formatting options that you can pass to &#8216;log&#8217;, such as <code>--stat</code>. If I wanted to see an overview of what all changed between version 1.6.1.1 and 1.6.1.2 in the Git project, I could run this:</p>

<pre><code>$ git diff v1.6.1.1 v1.6.1.2 --stat

<h3 id='what_a_merge_would_introduce'>what a merge would introduce</h3>

<p>Another interesting question that you can answer with &#8216;diff&#8217; is what a merge would introduce. This is a strange question, because if you have a line of work that diverged into two branches and you directly compare the snapshots, it&#8217;s going to try to tell you how to get from one state to the other.</p>

<p>For instance, if you create a &#8216;dev&#8217; branch and add a function to a file, then go back to your &#8216;master&#8217; branch and remove a line from the README, and then run something like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ git diff master dev</code></pre>

<p>It will tell you that a function was added from the first file and a line was <em>added</em> to the README. Why? Because on the branch, the README still has the original line, but on &#8216;master&#8217; you&#8217;ve removed it - so directly comparing the snapshots looks like &#8216;dev&#8217; added it. What you really want to compare is what &#8216;dev&#8217; has changed <em>since</em> your branches diverged. To do that, Git has a nice little shorthand:</p>

<pre><code>$ git diff master...dev</code></pre>

<p>This will not compare the last &#8216;master&#8217; branch snapshot and the last &#8216;dev&#8217; snapshot - it will instead compare the <em>common ancestor</em> of both with &#8216;dev&#8217;. That will tell you what changed <em>since</em> the branch point. In our example, it would just say that the function was added. If you are currently on the &#8216;master&#8217; branch, you can just run this instead:</p>

<pre><code>$ git diff ...dev</code></pre>

<p>So, if you want to see what would change in detail if you merged in a particular branch, you can just run</p>

<pre><code>$ git diff ...(branch)</code></pre>

<p>Where (branch) is the name of the branch you&#8217;re considering merging.</p><br/><br/><hr/></div><div class="span-10"><a href="log.html">&laquo; previous</a></div><div style="text-align:right" class="span-11 last"><a href="remotes.html">next &raquo;</a></div><div class="span-24 last">&nbsp;</div><hr/>
